\cvsection{Research Work}
\cvproject{Traffic model  (2015)}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The model based on cellular Automata and Monte-Carol method aim to solve the traffic congestion problem under the influence of " Keep right except to pass rule", simulating the traffic on two-lane freeway based on Simulink platform,recoording the average velocity, overtaking rate, road density and danger index to assess the performance of keep right rule by comparison with unconstricted rule
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Epidemic model (2016)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The model based on SEIR multi-agent system aims to detect the relationships between different intervening factors and Infected numbers. Netlogo and Simulink been used to output the solution curve of SEIR numbers 
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Chinstrap penguin Conservation strategy  (2021)}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The model based on the proposed Usher matrix to analyse the dynamic changing pattern of  Chinstrap penguin specie's numbers at Antarctic land and its factor's elasticity's, aims to propose a conservation strategy for protecting the penguin species
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Multi-species competition model (2021)}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
This model built for detecting travelling wave phenomenon and its application of a certain multi-species environment, aims to find solutions to its PDE system and based on it to analyse the competition mechanism among multi-species
